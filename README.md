Rocket Elevators Information System

https://apexrockets.xyz/

This Program's purpose is to make a dynamic web site for our clients to admistrate and use our back office. In there you can see the list of employees, quotes, addresses, customers, buildings ,batteries, columns, elevators and users.

We created two types of database , one relational database and one data warehouse for decision-making.
We have entered fictious data to test our database and analyse our data.

A data warehouse contains facts (contacts, bid solicitations, sales, incidents, interventions, alerts, alarms, etc.) and dimensions with which these facts can be analyzed (Time, employees, customers, elevators, buildings, etc.). ). In other words, things happen within a system and they impact or involve things or people.
